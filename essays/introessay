Aloha, my name is Kevin Kung and I’m 3 semesters away from graduating with a major in Marketing and a minor in Communicology. I’ve always been curious in building things, from blocks to furniture to computers, and have always been interested in learning how to code. I was introduced to the world of MIS and information systems from BUS 311 last semester.  I decided to join this class because I am interested in finding a career in data/marketing analytics. I am also exploring the possibility to add MIS as a double major.
	I hope to use the knowledge I gain from this course to add more skills to my toolbelt that will hopefully help me in my future career. In my free time I like snowboarding, surfing, playing video games, listening to music, spending time with friends, and socializing with my brothers in the Kappa Sigma Fraternity. Best of luck to everyone this semester!
